<sect>Notice
<p>
The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-3.5.0.0 for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/"> or the
 <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Mirrors/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">
 for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Known issues
<p>
Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of 
<url url="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;product=Squid&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;version=3.5" name="open bugs against Squid-3.5">.

<sect1>Changes since earlier releases of Squid-3.5
<p>
The 3.5 change history can be <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/" name="viewed here">.


<sect>Major new features since Squid-3.4
<p>Squid 3.5 represents a new feature release above 3.4.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>Support libecap v1.0
	<item>Authentication helper query extensions
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).


<sect1>Support libecap v1.0
<p>Details at <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/BLAH">.

<p>The new libecap version allows Squid to better check the version of
  the eCAP adapter being loaded as well as the version of the eCAP library
  being used.

<p>Squid-3.5 can support eCAP adapters built with libecap v1.0,
   but no longer supports adapters built with earlier libecap versions
   due to API changes.


<sect1>Authentication helper query extensions
<p>Details at <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/auth_param/">.

<p>The new <em>key_extras</em> parameter allows sending of additional
  details to the authentication helper beyond the minimum required for
  the HTTP authentication. This is primarily intended to allow switching
  of authentication databases based on criteria such as client IP subnet,
  Squid receiving port, or in reverse-proxy the requested domain name.

<p>In theory any <em>logformat</em> code may be used, however only the
  codes which have available details at the time of authentication
  will send any meaningful detail.


<sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-3.4
<p>
There have been changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-3.4.

<p>Squid supports reading configuration option parameters from external
   files using the syntax <em>parameters("/path/filename")</em>. For example:
<verb>
    acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("/etc/squid/whitelist.txt")
</verb>

<p>There have also been changes to individual directives in the config file.

This section gives a thorough account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newtags" name="New tags">
	<item><ref id="modifiedtags" name="Changes to existing tags">
	<item><ref id="removedtags" name="Removed tags">
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>New tags<label id="newtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>collapsed_forwarding</tag>
	<p>Ported from Squid-2 with no configuration or visible behaviour changes.
           Collapsing of requests is performed across SMP workers.

	<tag>send_hit</tag>
	<p>New configuration directive to enable/disable sending cached content
	   based on ACL selection. ACL can be based on client request or cached
	   response details.

	<tag>store_miss</tag>
	<p>New configuration directive to enable/disable caching of MISS responses.
	   ACL can be based on any request or response details.

</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing tags<label id="modifiedtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>acl</tag>
	<p>New type <em>adaptation_service</em> to match the name of any
	   icap_service, ecap_service, adaptation_service_set, or
	   adaptation_service_chain that Squid has used (or attempted to use)
	   for the HTTP transaction so far.

	<tag>auth_param</tag>
	<p>New parameter <em>key_extras</em> to send additional parameters to
	   the authentication helper.

	<tag>forward_max_tries</tag>
	<p>Default value increased to <em>25 destinations/em> to allow better
	   contact and IPv4 failover with domains using long lists of IPv6
	   addresses.

	<tag>http_port</tag>
	<p><em>protocol=</em> option altered to accept protocol version details.
	   Currently supported values are: HTTP, HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTPS/1.1

	<tag>logformat</tag>
	<p>New format code <em>%credentials</em> to log the client credentials
	   token.
	<p>New format code <em>%tS</em> to log transaction start time in
	   "seconds.milliseconds" format, similar to the existing access.log
	   "current time" field (%ts.%03tu) which logs the corresponding
	   transaction finish time.

</descrip>

<sect1>Removed tags<label id="removedtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>cache_dir</tag>
	<p><em>COSS</em> storage type is formally replaced by Rosk storage type.

	<tag>cache_dns_program</tag>
	<p>DNS external helper interface has been removed. It was no longer
	   able to provide high performance service and the internal DNS
	   client library with multicast DNS cover all modern use-cases.

	<p>DNS external helper interface has been removed.
